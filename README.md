# realTimeBusLocation
This app will display city bus location in real-time.

Description of Project: This project allows user to use real time bus location data from the MBTA bus data to plot the locations of all the buses in Boston area between MIT & Harvard. We use 2 different colors of the bus icons to distinguish whether the bus is going to MIT or Harvard. The app will automatically refresh every 15 seconds to find new locations of the buses.

How to Run: No software installation is needed. After the browser is loaded, user can see all the locations of the buses updated every 15 seconds.

Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to display additional inforation such as the bus number, how many seats are available, the GPS locations of all available buses.
